TI  - Cortisol in mood disorders.
PG  - 205-8
AB  - Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been 
      well-described in mood disorders. Hypercortisolaemia, which has been attributed 
      to a breakdown in glucocorticoid-receptor-mediated negative feedback mechanisms 
      within the HPA axis, may be central to the pathogenesis of both the depressive 
      symptoms and the cognitive deficits, which characterise severe mood disorders. 
      Strategies to normalise glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function, and thus restore 
      HPA functional integrity, have been the focus of recent research. Preliminary 
      preclinical and clinical studies report encouraging results which suggest that 
      lowering circulating cortisol levels, by up-regulating GRs, may have therapeutic 
      efficacy in terms of improvements in depressive symptoms and cognitive 
      functioning.
