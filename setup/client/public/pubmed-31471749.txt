AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on the concentration of cortisol in human 
      hair as a biomarker of chronic stress in cardiovascular disease (CVD). We outline 
      the cardiovascular consequences of cortisol excess and provide a comprehensive 
      overview of recent studies investigating the relationship of hair cortisol with 
      CVD. In addition, clinical implications and limitations of the evidence are 
      discussed, together with directions for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Hair 
      cortisol may be a reliable biomarker of chronic stress since it provides 
      quantification of total cortisol secreted into hair over several weeks. A growing 
      body of evidence suggests that elevated hair cortisol levels are associated with 
      both the incidence of CVD and poorer recovery and treatment outcomes. Moreover, 
      increased hair cortisol concentration has been linked with established 
      cardiometabolic risk factors for CVD including high blood pressure, diabetes, and 
      adiposity. Hair cortisol is a promising biomarker of chronic cortisol excess 
      which may contribute to both the pathogenesis and prognosis of CVD. However, the 
      current evidence relies on small-scale cross-sectional studies. Further research 
      adopting longitudinal designs across larger samples of CVD patients and healthy 
      participants is required to inform the development of novel evidence-based 
      interventions.
