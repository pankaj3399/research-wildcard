AB  - Changes in levels of the stress-sensitive hormone cortisol from morning to 
      evening are referred to as diurnal cortisol slopes. Flatter diurnal cortisol 
      slopes have been proposed as a mediator between chronic psychosocial stress and 
      poor mental and physical health outcomes in past theory and research. 
      Surprisingly, neither a systematic nor a meta-analytic review of associations 
      between diurnal cortisol slopes and health has been conducted to date, despite 
      extensive literature on the topic. The current systematic review and 
      meta-analysis examined associations between diurnal cortisol slopes and physical 
      and mental health outcomes. Analyses were based on 179 associations from 80 
      studies for the time period up to January 31, 2015. Results indicated a 
      significant association between flatter diurnal cortisol slopes and poorer health 
      across all studies (average effect size, r=0.147). Further, flatter diurnal 
      cortisol slopes were associated with poorer health in 10 out of 12 subtypes of 
      emotional and physical health outcomes examined. Among these subtypes, the effect 
      size was largest for immune/inflammation outcomes (r=0.288). Potential moderators 
      of the associations between diurnal cortisol slopes and health outcomes were 
      examined, including type of slope measure and study quality indices. The possible 
      roles of flatter slopes as either a marker or a mechanism for disease etiology 
      are discussed. We argue that flatter diurnal cortisol slopes may both reflect and 
      contribute to stress-related dysregulation of central and peripheral circadian 
      mechanisms, with corresponding downstream effects on multiple aspects of biology, 
      behavior, and health.
